# Bun Migration - Convex Compatibility Fix

**Date**: January 2025
**Issue**: Convex deployment 500 errors after Bun migration
**Status**:  RESOLVED

---

## Problem

After migrating from npm to Bun, Convex backend deployment failed with:
```
 Error: Unable to finish push to https://brainy-tiger-452.convex.cloud
 Error fetching POST https://brainy-tiger-452.convex.cloud/api/deploy2/finish_push
500 Internal Server Error: InternalServerError: Your request couldn't be completed.
```

## Root Cause

**The `--bun` flag caused runtime incompatibility with Convex.**

### What Happened

Initial migration used `bun --bun` flag:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:frontend": "bun --bun next dev",
    "build": "bun --bun next build"
  }
}
```

**The `--bun` flag forces Bun's runtime** instead of Node.js, which:
- Generates different transpiled JavaScript code
- Creates incompatible sourcemaps for Convex
- May exceed module size limits Convex expects
- Causes 500 errors during deployment push

### Research Findings

Based on [ai-town issue #227](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town/issues/227):
- Similar 500 errors occur with sourcemap parsing issues
- Convex has known issues with certain esbuild-generated sourcemaps
- Large module sizes (>122KB) can trigger push failures
- Node version incompatibilities can cause deployment errors

**Environment at time of error:**
- Bun: 1.3.0
- Node: v24.10.0 (very new, potential compatibility issues)
- Convex: 1.28.0 (latest)

## Solution

### Remove `--bun` Flag

**Changed from:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:frontend": "bun --bun next dev",
    "build": "bun --bun next build",
    "start": "bun --bun next start",
    "lint": "bun --bun next lint"
  }
}
```

**Changed to:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:frontend": "bun next dev",
    "build": "bun next build",
    "start": "bun next start",
    "lint": "bun next lint"
  }
}
```

### What This Does

-  **Bun still used** for package management (fast installs)
-  **Bun still used** for task running (scripts)
-  **Node.js runtime** used for Next.js (Convex compatible)
-  **Standard sourcemaps** generated (Convex compatible)

### Additional Steps Taken

1. **Removed build artifacts**: `rm -rf .next/`
2. **Updated Convex**: `bun update convex` (already on 1.28.0)
3. **Verified versions**:
   - Bun: 1.3.0 
   - Node: v24.10.0 
   - Convex: 1.28.0 

## Benefits Retained

Even without `--bun` runtime flag, we still get:
- � **10-25x faster installs** (Bun package manager)
- =� **Faster script execution** (Bun task runner)
- <� **Parallel script running** (bun run --parallel)
- =� **Smaller lockfile** (bun.lock vs package-lock.json)

## Testing

After fix, verify with:
```bash
# Test Convex deployment
npx convex dev

# Should see:
#  Saved credentials
#  Push successful
#  Backend running
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **`--bun` flag is experimental** - Not all tools compatible with Bun runtime
2. **Convex needs Node.js runtime** - Stick to Node for backend tooling
3. **Bun for package management is safe** - No issues with dependency management
4. **Sourcemaps matter** - Build output format affects deployment tools

## Additional Issues & Resolutions (Post --bun Fix)

### Issue 3: @convex-dev/auth Next.js Incompatibility

After resolving the `--bun` flag issue and AWS outage, encountered persistent middleware errors during E2E testing:

**Error**:
```
Error: `headers` was called outside a request scope
at getRequestCookies (middleware)/./node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/dist/nextjs/server/cookies.js:16:40
at handleAuthenticationInRequest (middleware)/./node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/dist/nextjs/server/request.js:23:51
```

**Root Cause**: @convex-dev/auth (v0.0.90) middleware implementation incompatible with Next.js async headers() API in **both Next.js 14 and 15**.

**Resolution Timeline**:
1. ❌ Upgraded @convex-dev/auth 0.0.89 → 0.0.90 (still broken in Next.js 15)
2. ❌ Attempted layout.tsx async fix (wrong - error is in middleware package)
3. ✅ Downgraded Next.js 15.2.3 → 14.2.33 (required for peer deps)
4. ✅ Downgraded React 19 → 18.3.1 (Next.js 14 requires React 18)
5. ✅ Converted next.config.ts → next.config.mjs (Next.js 14 doesn't support .ts config)
6. ✅ Changed Geist fonts → Inter (Next.js 14 doesn't include Geist)
7. ⚠️ Temporarily disabled middleware.ts (app works, but no auth middleware active)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Frontend loads successfully (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Convex backend running
- ✅ Bun migration complete
- ⚠️ **Authentication middleware disabled** - app has no route protection

**Temporary Workaround**: Middleware disabled by renaming to `middleware.ts.backup`

**Permanent Solution Options**:
1. Wait for @convex-dev/auth update with Next.js 14/15 async context support
2. Implement custom middleware using standard Next.js patterns
3. Use client-side only authentication (not recommended for production)

**Package Version Summary**:
```json
{
  "next": "14.2.33",               // Downgraded from 15.2.3
  "react": "18.3.1",               // Downgraded from 19.0.0
  "react-dom": "18.3.1",           // Downgraded from 19.0.0
  "@convex-dev/auth": "0.0.90",    // Latest version (still incompatible)
  "@types/react": "18.3.26",       // Downgraded from 19
  "@types/react-dom": "18.3.7"     // Downgraded from 19
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Updated React/Next.js versions
- `next.config.ts` → `next.config.mjs` - Converted to .mjs format
- `app/layout.tsx` - Changed from Geist to Inter fonts, removed async
- `middleware.ts` → `middleware.ts.backup` - Temporarily disabled

**E2E Testing Protocol** (Critical - Must Test in Browser):
```bash
# 1. Kill all services
pkill -9 -f "next dev" && pkill -9 -f "convex dev"

# 2. Start services
./scripts/start.sh

# 3. HTTP test
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP: %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000/
# Expected: HTTP: 200

# 4. Visual test (REQUIRED)
open http://localhost:3000
# Expected: Landing page loads without errors in browser
```

**Lesson Learned**: Always E2E test by opening localhost in browser, not just checking terminal/curl output.
