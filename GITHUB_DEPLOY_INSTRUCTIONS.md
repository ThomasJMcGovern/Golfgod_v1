# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Code is committed locally and ready to push
✅ Repository created at: https://github.com/ThomasJMcGovern/Golfgod_v1
❌ Push is blocked due to SSH key permissions

## Issue
The SSH key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_thomas` is currently associated with GitHub user "admingistai" but needs access to push to the ThomasJMcGovern/Golfgod_v1 repository.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Add SSH Key to ThomasJMcGovern Account
1. Copy your SSH public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_thomas.pub
   ```
   Output: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIY35y6cVK/aLgbEMp/y8q4pEnjm0xPIclKRJ/PeBYiG ThomasJMcGovern@github.com`

2. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Add the key with title "GolfGod Deployment Key"
5. Then push with:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Grant Repository Access to admingistai
1. Go to https://github.com/ThomasJMcGovern/Golfgod_v1
2. Click Settings → Manage access
3. Add "admingistai" as a collaborator with write access
4. Then push with:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Use a Different SSH Key
If you have another SSH key that's already configured with the ThomasJMcGovern account:
```bash
# List available keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/*.pub

# Configure git to use a different key (replace with your preferred key)
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/[YOUR_KEY_NAME]"

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

## After Successful Push
Once the code is pushed, your repository will be live at:
https://github.com/ThomasJMcGovern/Golfgod_v1
